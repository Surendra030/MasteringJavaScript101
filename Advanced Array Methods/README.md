# Introduction to JavaScript Arrays

Arrays are an essential part of JavaScript, providing a way to store and manipulate collections of data. Arrays can hold multiple values in a single variable, and they come with a variety of built-in methods that make working with data much more convenient and efficient.

In this guide, we'll be exploring some of the most useful methods available for arrays in JavaScript. These methods allow you to perform various operations such as adding and removing elements, searching for specific values, sorting and filtering data, and much more. By mastering these methods, you'll be able to handle data in your JavaScript applications more effectively.

Below is a comprehensive list of 100 array methods that you can use to manipulate arrays in JavaScript. Each method comes with a brief description to help you understand its purpose and how to use it.


# JavaScript Array Methods

Here are 100 methods that can be used on arrays in JavaScript

1. ### `at` (Returns the element at a given index)
2. ### `concat` (Merges two or more arrays)
3. ### `copyWithin` (Copies part of an array to another location in the same array)
4. ### `entries` (Returns a new Array Iterator object that contains the key/value pairs for each index in the array)
5. ### `every` (Tests whether all elements in the array pass a test)
6. ### `fill` (Fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value)
7. ### `filter` (Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test)
8. ### `find` (Returns the first element that passes a test)
9. ### `findIndex` (Returns the index of the first element that passes a test)
10. ### `findLast` (Returns the last element that passes a test)
11. ### `findLastIndex` (Returns the index of the last element that passes a test)
12. ### `flat` (Creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it)
13. ### `flatMap` (Maps each element using a mapping function and flattens the result into a new array)
14. ### `forEach` (Executes a provided function once for each array element)
15. ### `from` (Creates a new Array instance from an array-like or iterable object)
16. ### `includes` (Determines whether an array includes a certain value)
17. ### `indexOf` (Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array)
